# Experiment 12 – Container Orchestration using Kubernetes

## Objective

To study and analyse container orchestration using Kubernetes — deploying a WordPress application, exposing it via a Service, scaling pods, and demonstrating self-healing using `kubectl` on a k3d cluster.

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- `k3d` and `kubectl` installed
- A k3d cluster already created (`mycluster`)

---

## Theory

### Why Kubernetes over Docker Swarm?

| Reason | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Industry Standard | Most companies use Kubernetes in production |
| Powerful Scheduling | Automatically decides where to run containers |
| Large Ecosystem | Monitoring, logging, auto-scaling tools available |
| Cloud-Native | Works on AWS, GCP, Azure natively |

### Core Kubernetes Concepts

| Docker Concept | Kubernetes Equivalent | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Container | **Pod** | Smallest deployable unit; one or more containers |
| Compose service | **Deployment** | Defines how to run pods (image, replicas) |
| Load balancing | **Service** | Exposes pods with a stable IP/port |
| Scaling | **ReplicaSet** | Ensures desired number of pod copies always run |

## YAML Configuration Files

### `wordpress-deployment.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### `wordpress-service.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30007
```

## Procedure

### Task 1 – Start Cluster & Create Deployment

```bash
k3d cluster list
k3d cluster start mycluster
kubectl get nodes
kubectl apply -f wordpress-deployment.yaml
```

![Cluster Start & Deployment](../Screenshots/Exp12/12a.png)

**Observation:**
- `k3d cluster list` shows `mycluster` with load balancer enabled
- After `k3d cluster start mycluster`, the cluster boots with tools node, server node, and load balancer
- `kubectl get nodes` confirms node `k3d-mycluster-server-0` is `Ready` with role `control-plane,master` running Kubernetes `v1.31.5+k3s1`
- `kubectl apply -f wordpress-deployment.yaml` → `deployment.apps/wordpress created`

---

### Task 2 – Verify Pods, Apply Service & Port-Forward

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl apply -f wordpress-service.yaml
kubectl get svc
kubectl get svc wordpress-service
```

![Pods, Service](Screenshots/Screenshot(1082).png)

**Observation:**
- `kubectl get pods` shows **2 WordPress pods** running, both `1/1 Running`

---


**Observation:** WordPress database setup page is accessible at `localhost:8080`, confirming the deployment and service are working correctly. The page prompts for database connection details.

---

### Task 4 – Database Connection Error (Expected)

Submitted the database form with `localhost` as Database Host.

![Database Connection Error](../Screenshots/Exp12/12d.png)

**Observation:** WordPress throws **"Error establishing a database connection"**.

---

#### 🔴 Reason for the Error

No MySQL database pod or service was deployed in this experiment. WordPress requires a running MySQL instance to connect to, but since only the WordPress deployment was created, the connection to `localhost` fails — resulting in this error.

---

### Task 5 – Scale the Deployment

```bash
kubectl scale deployment wordpress --replicas=4
kubectl get pods
```

![Scaling to 4 Replicas](Screenshots/Screenshot(1084).png)

**Observation:**
- `deployment.apps/wordpress scaled` confirms the command executed successfully
- `kubectl get pods` shows **4 WordPress pods** all in `1/1 Running` state:
  - `wordpress-7d6f6db8d8-cl77g` — 19m (original)
  - `wordpress-7d6f6db8d8-vzcvn` — 19m (original)
  - `wordpress-7d6f6db8d8-tx8dv` — 14s (newly created)
  - `wordpress-7d6f6db8d8-zkzcq` — 14s (newly created)
- Kubernetes scaled from 2 → 4 replicas instantly

---

### Task 6 – Self-Healing Demonstration

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete pod wordpress-7d6f6db8d8-zkzcq
kubectl get pods
```

![Self-Healing](Screenshots/Screenshot(1085).png)

**Observation:**
- Pod `wordpress-7d6f6db8d8-zkzcq` was manually deleted
- Kubernetes **immediately detected** the replica count dropped below 4
- A new pod `wordpress-7d6f6db8d8-tw4zl` was **automatically created** (AGE: 11s)
- Final `kubectl get pods` still shows **4 running pods** — self-healing confirmed

---

### Task 7 – Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete -f wordpress-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f wordpress-deployment.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
```

![Cleanup](Screenshots/Screenshot(1086).png)

**Observation:**
- `service "wordpress-service" deleted from default namespace`
- `deployment.apps "wordpress" deleted from default namespace`
- `kubectl get pods` — only the pre-existing `apache` pod remains; all WordPress pods removed
- `kubectl get svc` — `wordpress-service` is gone; only `apache`, `kubernetes`, and `web` services remain

---

## Result

All tasks completed successfully:

| Task | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Start Cluster | `k3d cluster start mycluster` | Cluster ready, node `Ready` |
| Create Deployment | `kubectl apply -f wordpress-deployment.yaml` | 2 WordPress pods running |
| Expose Service | `kubectl apply -f wordpress-service.yaml` | NodePort service on port 30007 |
| Access App | Browser at `localhost:8080` | WordPress setup page loaded |
| DB Error (Expected) | — | Confirms multi-tier architecture needed |
| Scale | `kubectl scale deployment wordpress --replicas=4` | 4/4 pods running |
| Self-Healing | `kubectl delete pod <name>` | Pod auto-replaced, count stays at 4 |
| Cleanup | `kubectl delete -f` | All resources removed |

---

## Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes

| Feature | Docker Swarm | Kubernetes |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | Very easy | More complex |
| Scaling | Basic | Advanced (supports auto-scaling) |
| Ecosystem | Small | Huge (monitoring, logging, service mesh) |
| Industry Use | Rare | Industry standard |
| Cloud Support | Limited | Native on AWS, GCP, Azure |

kubectl delete pod <pod-name>                         # Delete a specific pod
kubectl delete -f <file.yaml>                         # Delete resource from YAML
kubectl port-forward service/<svc-name> 8080:80       # Forward local port to service
